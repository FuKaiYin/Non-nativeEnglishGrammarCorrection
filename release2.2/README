NUCLE Release 2.2
1 Apr 2013

This README file describes the NUS Corpus of Learner English (NUCLE).
It was collected in a collaboration project between the National
University of Singapore (NUS) Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group
led by Prof. Hwee Tou Ng and the NUS Centre for English Language
Communication (CELC) led by Prof. Siew Mei Wu. The work was carried
out as part of the PhD thesis research of Daniel Dahlmeier at the NUS
NLP Group.

The corpus is distributed under the standard NUS licensing agreement
available when downloading the corpus. Any questions regarding NUCLE
should be directed to Hwee Tou Ng at: nght@comp.nus.edu.sg


1. About
========

NUCLE is a corpus of learner English. It consists of about 1,400
essays written by university students at the National University of
Singapore on a wide range of topics, such as environmental pollution,
healthcare, etc. It contains over one million words which are
completely annotated with error categories and corrections. All
annotations have been performed by professional English instructors at
the NUS CELC.


2. Data Format 
==============

The corpus is distributed in a simple SGML format.  All annotations
come in a "stand-off" format. The start position and end position of
an annotation are given by paragraph and character offsets.
Paragraphs are enclosed in <P>...</P> tags. Paragraphs and characters
are counted starting from zero. Each annotation includes the following
fields: the error category, the correction, and optionally a
comment. If the correction replaces the original text at the given
location, it should fix the grammatical error.

Example:

<DOC nid="840">
<TEXT>
<P>
Engineering design process can be defined as a process ...
</P>
<P>
Firstly, engineering design ...
</P>
...
</TEXT>
<ANNOTATION teacher_id="173">
<MISTAKE start_par="0" start_off="0" end_par="0" end_off="26">
<TYPE>ArtOrDet</TYPE>
<CORRECTION>The engineering design process</CORRECTION>
</MISTAKE>
...
</ANNOTATION>
</DOC>
<DOC nid="862">

3. Updates included in version 2.1
==================================

The major change made in version 2.1 is to map the error categories
Wcip and Rloc to Prep, Wci, ArtOrDet, and Rloc-.

In the original NUCLE corpus, there is not an explicit preposition
error category. Instead, preposition errors are part of the Wcip
(Wrong collocation/idiom/preposition) and Rloc (local redundancy)
error categories. In addition, redundant article or determiner errors
are part of the Rloc error category.

To facilitate the detection and correction of preposition errors and
article/determiner errors, we perform mapping of error categories in
the original NUCLE corpus. The mapping relies on POS tags, constituent
parse trees, and error annotations at the token level.

(a) Conditions to change from the error category Wcip or Rloc to Prep:

This applies to replacing a preposition by another preposition, or
deleting a preposition. The string to be replaced is one word w with
POS tag IN or TO, the parent of w is a PP in the constituent parse
tree, and the replacement is either a preposition or the empty string.

(b) Conditions to change from the error category Wcip to Prep:

This applies to inserting a preposition. The replacement is a
preposition (one word only) and the immediately following word is
tagged as VBG or is the first word of a noun phrase (NP).

(c) Conditions to change from the error category Rloc to ArtOrDet:

The single word has POS tag DT and the replacement is the empty
string.

The remaining unaffected "Wcip" errors are assigned the new error
category "Wci" and the remaining unaffected "Rloc" errors are assigned
the new error category "Rloc-".

List of 36 Prepositions:

about along among around as at beside besides between by down during
except for from in inside into of off on onto outside over through to
toward towards under underneath until up upon with within without
